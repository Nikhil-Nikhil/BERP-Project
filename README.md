# BERP-Project
The BERP (Bikloo Enterprise Resource Planning) is a Course Project for MAD3115 for semester 1 in Lambton College of Toronto. This project is made with the contribution of Das Tarlochan Singh and Nikhil Thakur (Links available in Contributors) . We as a team came up with an idea to make ERPs for the small scale businesses which can work on their own mobile phones or tablets. This is just to demonstrate one phase of the complete project.
